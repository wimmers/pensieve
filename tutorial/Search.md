Pensieve works on a plain folder of Markdown (`.md`) files like this folder (`tutorial`).

Every grey node in the graph above presents a single file/note in the folder.

This means every note in the folder can be edited by many other tools, e.g.:
- most code/text editors,
- or specialized tools like [Notable](https://notable.app).

To continue, click on ["Editing"](Editing.md).
