The arrows between nodes (or notes) in the graph,
represent links that are found in the notes' texts.

Try adding a link to the start node:
- Move the cursor here:
- Press the button `+ link`
- Click on the start node
- Type a name for the link, e.g. "start node"

You should see that a link was added at the cursor position.

There are three types of links:
- regular links (dashed lines, button `+link`)
- cross references (dotted lines, button `+crossref`)
- references to a note's origin (solid lines, button `+from`)

You can use these links as you like.
Note that the last two types are in a format that is compatible with [Notable](https://notable.app).

When you are done playing with links, go to ["Tags"](Tags.md).
