# End of tutorial

You have reached the end of the tutorial.

Here are a few more things you can try:

- [add a note](Adding a note.md)
- refresh

## Using the app

If you are ready to use the app seriously, do the following:

- Create a folder for your notes
- Run `python3 api.py <path-to-your-notes-folder>`
- As the app is in a very early stage of development, I strongly recommend putting your notes under some kind of version control or backup/synchronization solution.
