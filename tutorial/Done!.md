# End of tutorial

You have reached the end of the tutorial.

Here are a few more things you can try:
- add a note
- refresh

## Using the app
If you are ready to use the app seriously, do the following:
- Create a folder for your notes
- Run `python3 api.py <path-to-your-notes-folder>`
- As the app is in a very early stage of development, I strongly recommend to put your notes under some kind of version control or backup/synchronization solution.

## Known problems/feedback
