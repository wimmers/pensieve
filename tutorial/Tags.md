Notes can be tagged. Tags will be displayed as special nodes in the graph.

Try to add a few tags to this note:
- Type in the field that says "Add new tag" and press Enter

When you are done, press `refresh` and go back to this note.

You should now see the tags as nodes in the graph.
Note that this does not work in the demo. 

Continue to ["Search"](Search.md).
