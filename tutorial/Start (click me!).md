# Pensieve - Tutorial

This is a quick introduction on how to use Pensieve.

Pensieve lets you write down your notes as simple Markdown (`.md`) files.
To organize these notes, it allows you to organize your notes as a graph
like the one displayed above.
Each note is represented as a node in the graph.

You can start by clicking the "eye" icon in the upper right corner of this editor.
This gives you a nicer preview of these notes.

When you are ready to continue the the tutorial, click on the node named ["Editing"](Editing.md).
