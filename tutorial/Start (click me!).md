# Pensieve - Tutorial

This is a quick introduction to Pensieve.

Pensieve lets you write down your notes as simple Markdown (`.md`) files.
To organize these notes, it allows you to organize them as a graph
like the one displayed above.

You can start by clicking the "eye" icon in the upper right corner of this editor.
This gives you a nicer preview of the notes.

When you are ready to continue the tutorial, click on the node named ["Notes"](Notes.md).
